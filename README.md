ContactDirectory is a basic iOS app built with SwiftUI that allows browsing the contact details of the people by displaying user profiles from a remote API. The app features two main screens: 
**1. List of users
  2. Detailed view for each of the user**

##Features

- ** User List Screen: ** Displays a searchable list of users fetched from a remote API. The list displays name, email and photo of the user. The list offers refreshable list with pull down to refresh feature. 
- ** User Detail Screen: ** Displays detailed information of the selected user. The screen is divided into Sections - Personal Information, Contact, Address and displays user profile image.

## Technologies in the making

- ** Xcode 16.3 **
- ** SwiftUI **
- ** Swift **
- ** Swift DSL for Unit Testing with View Inspector**
- ** XCTest for UI Testing **
- ** Swift Package Manager to add dependencies **
- ** [View Inspector](https://github.com/nalexn/ViewInspector) package **

---

## Tech features and principles used

- **Dependency Injection** for testing and flexibilty
- **SOLID principles**
- **Generics** for testability, reusability and scalibility
- **Reusable** components
- **Observation**
- **Async/Await** - for ansynchronous and concurrency
- **Swift packages**
- **Unit Test and UI Test** with latest Swift DSL, ViewInspector and XCTest

---

## Architecture

- The app follows modular anf granular architecture for each of the features and components.
- MVVM is used for separating Presentation, Data and ViewModel layers.
- Observation is implemented to handle and detect changes and to reflect in the UI.
- SOLID principles, Generics and Dependency Injection is followed as design patterns and principles.
- Each features is kept in separate folder / group with each having its own Data, Presentation and ViewModel layer.
- Utilities contain reusable and common constants thoughout the app
- Network and Service protocols and implementation is kept as generic and resuable.

## Setup, Runtime environment and Usage

1. ** Clone the repository ** and used Xcode to open the `.xcodeproj`.
2. ** Swift Package Build ** wait for the package to resolve and install.
3. ** Build and run ** the app using iPhone device or sumulator
4. Wait for the list **to load** and tap on any row to open detailed screen.
5. On Main screen **Pull-To-Refresh** the content.
6. Use the **Search Bar** to filter the users by name.

---

## Test cases

- The app contains both UnitTest cases and UI Test cases for code coverage. 
1. **Unit Test Cases** 
    - Unit Test cases for the app are written with Swift DSL support. Unit Test cases also contain ViewInspector support for unit testing view hierarchy using Swift package - ViewInspector.
2. **UI Test Cases**
    - UI Test cases are written with XCTest framework. 
    
---

## Assumptions

- The API returns an Array of user object with some optional fields.
- Error handling is basic for demo purpose. Retry Logic is included.
- The app is designed for demonstration and as basic implementation. More changes can be added to the design, architecture and coding pattern while designing the app.

---

## Improvements

- Images downloaded can be **cached** and reloaded for faster support.
- Data can be stored in the **storages** like coredata, swiftdata, etc. for offline support
- Can implement **corrupt or fake data (e.g: Faker data) handling** with more understanding of the JSON data.
- **Test cases can be improved** upon and code coverage can be increased.
- Should add **swift lint** framework for linting

---

## Known Issues

- Some user images may not load due to API limitations.
- Error messages and handling is basic and cab be improved.
- Some Test cases are failing and can be made 100% success with more efforts.
