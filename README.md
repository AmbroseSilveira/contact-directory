ContactDirectory is a basic iOS app built with SwiftUI that allows browsing the contact details of the people by displaying user profiles from a remote API. The app features two main screens: 
**1. List of users
  2. Detailed view for each of the user**

## Features

- **User List Screen:** Displays a searchable list of users fetched from a remote API. The list displays name, email and photo of the user. The list offers refreshable list with pull down to refresh feature. 
- **User Detail Screen:** Displays detailed information of the selected user. The screen is divided into Sections - Personal Information, Contact, Address and displays user profile image.

---

## Technologies in the making

- **Xcode 16.3**
- **SwiftUI**
- **Swift**
- **Swift DSL for Unit Testing with View Inspector**
- **XCTest for UI Testing**
- **Swift Package Manager to add dependencies**
- **[View Inspector](https://github.com/nalexn/ViewInspector) package**

---

## Tech features and principles used

- **Dependency Injection** for testing and flexibilty
- **SOLID principles**
- **Generics** for testability, reusability and scalibility
- **Reusable** components
- **Observation**
- **Async/Await** - for ansynchronous and concurrency
- **Swift packages**
- **Unit Test and UI Test** with latest Swift DSL, ViewInspector and XCTest

---

## Architecture

- The app follows modular anf granular architecture for each of the features and components.
- MVVM is used for separating Presentation, Data and ViewModel layers.
- Observation is implemented to handle and detect changes and to reflect in the UI.
- SOLID principles, Generics and Dependency Injection is followed as design patterns and principles.
- Each features is kept in separate folder / group with each having its own Data, Presentation and ViewModel layer.
- Utilities contain reusable and common constants thoughout the app
- Network and Service protocols and implementation is kept as generic and resuable.

## Setup, Runtime environment and Usage

1. **Clone the repository** and used Xcode to open the `.xcodeproj`.
2. **Swift Package Build** wait for the package to resolve and install.
3. **Build and run** the app using iPhone device or sumulator
4. Wait for the list **to load** and tap on any row to open detailed screen.
5. On Main screen **Pull-To-Refresh** the content.
6. Use the **Search Bar** to filter the users by name.

## Test cases

- The app contains both UnitTest cases and UI Test cases for code coverage. 
1. **Unit Test Cases** 
    - Unit Test cases for the app are written with Swift DSL support. Unit Test cases also contain ViewInspector support for unit testing view hierarchy using Swift package - ViewInspector.
2. **UI Test Cases**
    - UI Test cases are written with XCTest framework. 
> **Note:**  
> Basic test case suite is added for the assignment purpose.

---

## Assumptions

- The API returns an Array of user object with some optional fields.
- Error handling is basic for demo purpose. Retry Logic is included.
- The app is designed for demonstration and as basic implementation. More changes can be added to the design, architecture and coding pattern while designing the app.

---

## Improvements

- Use **LazyContainer like LazyVstack, LazyHStack** for data display. used basic for assignment. Implement **pagination and background data fetches** for huge data sizes.
- Images downloaded can be **cached** and reloaded for faster support.
- Data can be stored in the **storages** like coredata, swiftdata, etc. for offline support.
- Add **Reachability** for network and error handling
- Can implement **corrupt or fake data (e.g: Faker data) handling** with more understanding of the JSON data.
- **Test cases can be improved** upon and code coverage can be increased. Testcases for `AppConstants` and UI, network and service must be added and improved.
- Should add **swift lint** framework for linting.
- Can add **Extensions** for custom logid. e.g.: parsing a string for error.
- Better **Error Handling** and error-mapping.
- Can user `@Statobject` and `@ObservedObject` with `@Publish` for compatibility.
- Newtorking can have **Logging** for debugging.
- Can make **swift packages for networking** and other reusbale components for modularity.

---

## Known Issues

- Some user images may not load due to API limitations.
- Error messages and handling is basic and cab be improved.
- Some Test cases are failing and can be made 100% success with additional efforts. Some test cases are intermittently failing specially for UI
